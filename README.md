# Hello, there
### My name is Andr√°s, welcome to my repository.
I am a :electron:Chemcial Engineer working in the :oil_drum:Oil & Gas industry. <br>
üåé I am fluent in Hungarian, English and Spanish. <br>

At work I 
- :test_tube: develop awesome new products for the automotive industry.
- :wrench: resolve technical issues in production and use.
- :thinking: come up with new ideas to increase efficiency and save money.
- :relaxed: support sales and clients regarding technical questions.

In my free time I
- :nerd_face: challenge myself by learning new tools ( :snake:Python, 	:scroll:SQL, :leaves:MongoDB...). 
- :bar_chart: develop Data Science projects (:chart:Analysis, :robot:Machine Learning). 

#### üë®‚Äçüíª My objective and dream is to become a Data Scientist. 

Some of the projects I've been working on: 

- [Madrid Housing Data Analysis](https://github.com/gorogandras/madrid_housing_data_analysis) (or [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/gorogandras/madrid_housing_data_analysis/blob/main/madrid_housing_data_analysis.ipynb) for better map visualisation) - I created this project with data I downloaded from idealista.com real estate website. I was looking for a way to decide if an asset is overpriced or not. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis and price prediction with machine learning models.
